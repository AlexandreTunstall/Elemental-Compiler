-- Verify that weird foreign names can still be used.

    These cases are currently disabled because they don't work. The best way of
    fixing this is probably to change the `ForeignName` type to use bytestring
    instead of text (the last one isn't valid UTF-8).

foreign export "\xE3\x81\x82" main : IO (∀ 0 → 0)
foreign export "\xF0\x9F\xA4\x94" main : IO (∀ 0 → 0)
