This document describes the compilation pipeline followed by the Elemental compiler.

# Converting a Source File into a Syntax Tree

This step can be skipped if there is already a syntax tree for the program, for example if it was generated by a frontend compiler.

1. Parse the source file into a stream of lexemes.
2. Convert the stream of lexemes into an abstract syntax tree (AST).

Note that there is no need for name resolution since names are already unambiguous and unscoped.

# Type Checking

Verify that all of the types in the program are legal.

1. Generate type constraints from the program's AST.
2. Check the type constraints.

# Optimisation

Optimisation is an entirely optional step since LLVM modules are emitted using normalisation rules, but it could yield better compiler performance.
It can be done through strong normalisation of the program's expressions.

1. Inline all the references to other expressions inside expressions.
2. Normalise all bindings by following a simple set of strongly normalising rewrite rules.

# LLVM Generation

Generate the appropriate LLVM code for the program by interpreting the program.

1. Replace all wired-in and imported definitions with corresponding internal expressions.
2. Normalise the new AST into an LLVM module.

Once the LLVM is generated, the compiler may opt to use LLVM tools to compile it into assembly or machine code.
